# Work-Day-Scheduler UNH Bootcamp HW#5 Bryan Pero

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. Events are saved in local storage. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
It uses the Moment.js library to work with date and time.
